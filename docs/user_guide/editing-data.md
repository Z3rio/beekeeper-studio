## Navigating the table


## Selecting multiple cells

You can select either a single cell, a single row, or a range of rows. You cannot (yet) select an arbitrary set of cells or columns.

To multi-select rows:

1. Select a row
2. `cmd/ctrl + click` to select a second row
3. `shift + click` to select a continuous range of rows
4. Esc, or click away to cancel the selection

## Copying Data

The table view allows you to copy

- An individual cell
- An entire row
- An arbitrary set of selected rows.

If you press the `copy` keyboard shortcut (`ctrl+c` or `cmd+c`), you will copy the data in a spreadsheet-friendly format (it will paste beautifully into Google Sheets or Excel)

Alternatively, right-click any cell to copy that row (or all selected rows) in a range of formats like CSV, JSON, and Markdown.

## Editing Data

!!! note
    Beekeeper only supports editing tables with primary keys.


Beekeeper has a unique design that 'stages' changes before applying them, so you can make multiple changes to be applied inside of a single transaction.

Staged change types are indicated by color:

- Green - new data to be added
- Red - data to be deleted
- Orange - data to be updated

To commit a change, click the `Apply` in the bottom right of the screen. To discard the change, click `Reset`.

!!! warning
    Sorting or filtering the table during editing will discard your staged changes.

## Editing Options

1. Click a cell to edit the contents
2. Right click a row and select `clone` to duplicate the row
3. Right click a row and select `delete` to delete the row
4. Click `+` in the bottom right to add a new row
